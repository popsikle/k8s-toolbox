I use this to debug k8s installs, I deploy it to a k8s cluster via a deployment yaml:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: toolbox-deployment
  labels:
    app: toolbox
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: toolbox
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: toolbox
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: toolbox
        image: popsikle/toolbox
        command: ["bash","-c","while true; do sleep 60s; done"]
```

And then I just exec into the pod!
